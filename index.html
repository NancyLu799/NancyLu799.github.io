	<p> I am a junior at Yale University completing a double major in biology and stats. I am particularly interested in computational biology, especially genomics, as well as biostatistics. After competing extensively in national high school math competitions including <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions">USAMO</a>, <a href="https://www.usamts.org">USAMTS</a>, and <a href="https://mathprize.atfoundation.org/">Math Prize</a>, I knew that I loved the thrill of piecing together mathematical puzzles. At Yale, I fell in love with biology, and subsequently have found the fusion of mathematical techniques and biology to be especially fascinating.  
	
	<p>
	Currently, I conduct research under Dr. Pyle and I focus on using computational techniques to analyze covariate base pairs in RNA structure. This covariation across distantly related species can tell us about the evolutionary history of RNA, which differs considerably from that of DNA. Ultimately, with this knowledge, we will write software that gives 3D predictions of various RNA tertiary structures from their nucleic acid sequences. My advisors are Dr. Moreno and Dr. Pyle.

	<p> This page contains some of my work at Yale. It is currently under construction.

</h4>
	This is my final project for CBB 472: Biomedical Data Science (Mining and Modeling). Given the high heritability of Alzheimer's Disease as well as its late onset, this disease is particularly interesting to study. Our team used SNP annotation tools alongside GWAS studies to predict Carl Zimmer's Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk given his complete genome.

</h4>
	Since the summer of 2016, I have been working at the Magee-Womens Research Center (Univeristy of Pittsburgh Medical Center) on analyzing outcomes of bariatric surgery, and how these outcomes relate to mental health factors. Through statistical analyses including repeated-measured ANCOVA analyses and interaction analysis, I studied a large cohort of bariatric surgery outcomes and found that former physical, mental, or sexual abuse played a significant role in surgical outcomes. Paper to be published in late 2018.

</h4>
To help answer the question when children should seek help for mental health issues, I helped create 2 validated scales through extensive focus groups. These scales are targeted to parents and guardians to determine when the best time to seek treatment for mental health is. This research was presented at the American Psychological Society's annual conference in Boston (May 2017).

</h4>
I was part of Yale's iGEM (international Genomically Engineered Machinery) team in the summer of 2017. Our goal was to genetically E. coli capable of digesting plastics efficiently in a landfill situation. To do this, multiple non-native pathways including a PETase and MHETase pathway were engineered into the bacteria. The bacteria then underwent adaptive evolution to increase the rate of plastic metabolism. The team will compete later in the International Jamboree this year (Summer 2017).

</h4>
For my final project in SOCY 155: State and Society of Israel I examined the state of LGBT rights in Israel. I was particularly interested in the interaction between the publicly Jewish society and the progressive political changes in Israel. In particular, are Israel's outwardly progressive LGBT stances truly representative of its people? This paper received third place for the Yale Acheson Prize in International Relations. (June 2018)

</h4>
	 In this piece, I examine the opioid epidemic in the Yale Global Health Review. One of my close friends passed away from opioid overdose, and this issue has become one of the most pressing public health problems in the US. In this article, I provide an overview of the current solutions and which of those hold some promise. I have been involved with YGHR in various capacities since fall 2016, including serving as its Editor-in-chief in 2017-2018.

</h4>
	During this internship, I volunteered at New Life, a psychiatric rehabilitation facility in Hong Kong. Based on an innovative place-train-place model which gives those with severe psychiatric illnesses the ability to work (with guidance) in New Life businesses, this non-profit has been highly lauded as an example for many other countries. At the conclusion of this internship, I presented about the differences in the mental health systems of HK and the US (summer 2017).

	 <h4 class="media-heading"> First Foray in Genetic Engineering
</h4>
	One of the most pressing agricultural problems in the world is that many plant species have reached yield plateaus due to climate change. In this paper, I examine how we can use genetic engineering to insert Wuschel (WUS) and baby boom (BBM) genes as morphogenic regulators to turn sorghum cells totipotent, and thus increase their flowering time and crop yield. We used eQTL analysis and traditional genetic methods. This was the final project for my MCDB 200: Molecular Biology class (spring 2017).
