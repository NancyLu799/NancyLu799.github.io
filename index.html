	<p> Hi, I am a senior at Yale University completing a double major in biology and stats. This website serves as a repository to document my learning and interests throughout my education.</p>

	<p>I am particularly interested in computational biology, especially genomics, as well as biostatistics. Currently, my thesis work in the Gerstein Lab examines the feasibility of linkage attacks on genomic databases, which compromise genomic privacy. </p>
		
	<p>In the future, I plan on obtaining an MD, and examining computational solutions to biomedical problems. With an abundance of data and proliferation of new tools to analyze such data, I'm excited to see what the next big advances will be.</p>

	This is my final project for CBB 452: Biomedical Data Science (Mining and Modeling). The goal of this project was to calculate the Alzheimer's Disease risk of a patient, given his genome. Given the high heritability of Alzheimer's Disease as well as its late onset, studying this disease has immense potential in genomics. We used SNP annotation tools alongside GWAS studies in order to acccomplish this task.

</h4>
	Since the summer of 2016, I have been working at the Magee-Womens Research Center (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) on analyzing outcomes of bariatric surgery, and how these outcomes relate to mental health factors. Through statistical analyses including repeated-measured ANCOVA analyses and interaction analysis, I studied a large cohort of bariatric surgery outcomes and found that former physical, mental, or sexual abuse played a significant role in surgical outcomes. The paper was accepted for publication by Bariatric Surgical Practice and Patient Care.

</h4>
	To help answer the question when children should seek help for mental health issues, I helped create 2 validated psychological scales through principle components analysis of results from extensive focus groups and prior research. These scales are targeted to parents and guardians to determine the best time to seek treatment for children's mental health. This research was presented at the American Psychological Society's annual conference (May 2017).

</h4>
	I was part of Yale's iGEM (international Genomically Engineered Machinery) team in the summer of 2017. Our goal was to genetically <i>E. coli</i> capable of digesting polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics efficiently in a landfill situation. To do this, multiple non-native pathways including a PETase and MHETase pathway were engineered into the bacteria. The bacteria then underwent adaptive evolution and multiplex autonomic genomic engineering (MAGE) to increase the rate of plastic metabolism. We will compete later in the International Jamboree this year (Summer 2017).

	The William F. Buckley Jr. Program at Yale hosts an annual essay contest. The prompt for Fall 2018 asks: "What is the primary purpose of a liberal education?" In this paper, I argue that education should be free of institutional or national interests and should only exist to cultivate the person's own intellect. I received 2nd place for this essay.

	For my final project in SOCY 155: State and Society of Israel, I examined the state of LGBT rights in Israel. I was particularly interested in the interaction between the publicly Jewish society and the many progressive political changes in Israel. In particular, are Israel's outwardly progressive LGBT stances truly representative of its people? This paper received third place for the Yale Acheson Prize in International Relations. (June 2018)

In this article, I provide an overview of the current challenges and proposed solutions. I have been involved with YGHR in various capacities since fall 2016, including serving as its Editor-in-chief in 2017-2018.

Based on an innovative place-train-place model which gives those with severe psychiatric illnesses the ability to work (with guidance) in New Life businesses, this non-profit has been highly lauded as an example for many other countries. At the conclusion of this internship, I presented about the differences in the mental health systems of HK and the US (summer 2017).

</h4>
	One of the most pressing agricultural problems in the world is that many plant species have reached yield plateaus due to climate change. In this paper, I examine how we can use genetic engineering to insert Wuschel (WUS) and baby boom (BBM) genes as morphogenic regulators to turn sorghum cells totipotent, and thus increase their flowering time and crop yield. I used eQTL analysis and traditional genetic methods. This was the final project for my MCDB 201: Molecular Biology class (spring 2017).
